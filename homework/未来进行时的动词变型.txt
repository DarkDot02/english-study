future continuous
	positive:subject + am/is/are + doing + future
	i            	 	am 	     doing
	he/she/it		is 	     doing
	we/you/they	are  	     doing
	
	question:am/is/are + subject + doing + future

	
I am doing something tomorrow = I have arranged to do it, I have a plan to do it
	
Be careful! Do not use the present simple(I stay / do you go etc.) to say what somebody has arranged to do.
But we use the present simple for timetables,programmes,trains,buses etc.

compare:
present continuous(usually for people)
present simple(for timetables,programmes etc.)                              --Unit 25


I am going to do something = I have decided to do it,my intention is to do it        

something is going to happen = we can see now that it is sure to happen

--Unit 26


will + infinitive (will be / will win / will come etc.)

i/we/you/they/he/she/it  + will('ll) or will not (won't) + infinitive

question:will + subject(i/we/you......she/it) + infinitive ?

We use will for the future(tomorrow / next week etc.)
We often say I think ... will ...
We do not use will for things we have already arranged or decided to do(➡Units 25-26)

shall
You can say I shall(= I will) and we shall(=we will)
but do not use shall with you/they/he/she/it

will/shall
you can use I'll ...(I will) when you offer something or decide to do something
we often say I think i'll ... I don't think I'll ... when we decide to do something
Do not use the present simple (I go / I phone etc.) in sentences 
Do not use i'll ... for something you decided before(不要用will来表达已决定了的事情,可以用will表达正要决定的事情.)
Shall I / Shall we ... ? = Do you think this is a good thing to do ? Do you think this is a good idea?
