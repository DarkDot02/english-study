I am, I don't etc.

In these examples, it is not necessary to repeat some words('he is tired','she doesn't like tea').

You can use these verbs in the same way
am/is/are
was/were
have/has
do/does/did

You cannot use 'm/'s/'ve etc.(short forms)in this way.You must use am/is/have etc.
But you can use isn't/haven't/won't etc.(negative short forms)
You can use I am/I'm not etc. after Yes and No
We use do/does for the present simple
We use did for the past simple
